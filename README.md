A pure Go [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) server wire protocol implementation.
Build your own PostgreSQL server within a few lines of code.
This project attempts to make it as straight forward as possible to set-up and configure your own PSQL server.
Feel free to check out the [examples](https://github.com/suprsend/psql-wire/tree/main/examples) directory for various ways on how to configure/set-up your own server.

> ðŸš§ This project does not include a PSQL parser. Please check out other projects such as [auxten/postgresql-parser](https://github.com/auxten/postgresql-parser) to parse PSQL SQL queries.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	wire "github.com/suprsend/psql-wire"
)

func main() {
	wire.ListenAndServe("127.0.0.1:5432", handler)
}

func handler(ctx context.Context, query string) (wire.PreparedStatements, error) {
	return wire.Prepared(wire.NewStatement(func(ctx context.Context, writer wire.DataWriter, parameters []wire.Parameter) error {
		fmt.Println(query)
		return writer.Complete("OK")
	})), nil
}
```
